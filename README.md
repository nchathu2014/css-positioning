# CSS Positioning
Learn the CSS positioning

### Content
- **Fixed position**  
This position of an element **relative to the browser window**.  The element **always stays fixed in place**, even when scrolling.

- **Absolute position**  
This position of an element **out of document flow**, meaning the browser acts as if the element has no width and height, and the other elements on the page move up as if it was never there.  The position of the element is then fixed relative to the top level container, or the closest parent with a set positioning.

- **Relative position**  
This position of an element relative to its original position.  The element's original width and height is retained in document flow and other elements behave as if it was in its original position

- **Static position**  
This is the default behavior of elements

- **Inherit position**  
This is to inherit its positioning from its parent element.

- **Floating**
 Removes an element from normal document flow.  It then takes that element and pushes it to the far right/left as possible.  Other elements will move up as far as possible to flow around the element and take its orginal space.

- **Clear**
positions an element according to document flow, and then moves it to the far left or right as possible. Elements following a floated element will move up as far as possible.

- **Centering elements**
centering the elements vertically and horizontally
